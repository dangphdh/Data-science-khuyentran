    "## Introduction {#introduction}\n",
    "Text similarity is a fundamental challenge in data science. Whether you're detecting duplicates, clustering content, or building search systems, the core question remains: how do you determine when different text strings represent the same concept?\n",
    "Traditional exact matching fails with real-world data. Consider these common text similarity challenges:\n",
    "- **Formatting variations**: \"iPhone® 14 Pro Max\" vs \"IPHONE 14 pro max\" - identical products with different capitalization and symbols.\n",
    "- **Missing spaces**: \"iPhone14ProMax\" vs \"iPhone 14 Pro Max\" - same product name, completely different character sequences.\n",
    "- **Extra information**: \"Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max 256GB\" vs \"iPhone 14 Pro Max\" - additional details that obscure the core product.\n",
    "- **Semantic equivalence**: \"wireless headphones\" vs \"bluetooth earbuds\" - different words describing similar concepts.\n",
    "These challenges require different approaches:\n",
    "- **Regex preprocessing** cleans formatting inconsistencies\n",
    "- **difflib** provides character-level similarity scoring  \n",
    "- **RapidFuzz** handles fuzzy matching at scale\n",
    "- **Sentence Transformers** understands semantic relationships\n",
    "This guide demonstrates when to use each tool, progressing from simple preprocessing to AI-powered semantic understanding. By the end, you'll master the decision-making process for text similarity tools, implement each approach with confidence, and build scalable solutions for your specific use case.\n",
