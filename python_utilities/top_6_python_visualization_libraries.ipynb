    "### Quick Decision Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a quick decision guide to help you choose the right visualization library for your project:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose Matplotlib when:** Creating publication-quality static plots, need unlimited customization control, working on academic papers or research\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose seaborn when:** Making statistical visualizations quickly, want beautiful plots with minimal code, working with pandas DataFrames  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose Pygal when:** Building lightweight web applications, need SVG vector graphics that scale perfectly, want minimal dependencies and fast loading\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose Plotly when:** You need interactive visualizations with hover tooltips, zooming, and clickable legends, or when building web dashboards and applications that require user engagement with the data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose Altair when:** Doing statistical data exploration, want grammar-of-graphics approach, need linked/coordinated visualizations, working primarily in Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose Bokeh when:** Building complex interactive web applications, need linked plots and advanced interactions, want fine-grained control over web deployment, creating custom visualization tools\n",

    "#### Easy to interpret data properties\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing data, it's often helpful to get a quick overview of its distribution.\n",

    "### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limited styling options\n",
    "\n",
    "Altair's simple charts, such as bar charts, may not look as styled as those in libraries like seaborn or Plotly unless you specify custom styling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset size limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Altair recommends aggregating your data prior to visualization when dealing with datasets exceeding 5000 samples. Handling larger datasets may require additional steps to manage data size and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Altair excels at statistical visualization with intuitive grammar and linked plots that enable interactive exploration. While it simplifies complex data transformations, its styling limitations and constraints with large datasets may require workarounds for specialized visualization needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bokeh {#bokeh}\n",
    "\n",
    "[Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) is a highly flexible interactive visualization library designed for web browsers.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Interactive version of Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Bokeh stands out as the most similar library to Matplotlib when it comes to interactive visualization. While Matplotlib is a low-level visualization library, Bokeh offers both high-level and low-level interfaces. With Bokeh, you can create sophisticated plots similar to Matplotlib but with fewer lines of code and higher resolution.\n",
