    "# Retrieval-Augmented Generation using Ollama in Postgres\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Have you ever struggled to find information across different systems in your organization? Many organizations face this critical challenge: their valuable knowledge is scattered across different systems and formats. To find the information they need, they often have to search through multiple systems, which is time-consuming and inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "pgvector brings vector search capabilities to PostgreSQL, enabling fast and accurate information retrieval using large language models (LLMs). When used in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup, pgvector helps you build AI-powered search solutions that index and retrieve organizational knowledge with precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we'll build a simple RAG system using pgvector and Ollama.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools Used in This Article\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is Ollama?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ollama is a lightweight, open-source model server that allows you to run and interact with large language models (LLMs) on your local machine. It provides a simple interface for running and managing LLMs, making it easy to experiment with different models and fine-tune them for your specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on using Ollama in private AI workflows, check out this [guide](https://codecut.ai/private-ai-workflows-langchain-ollama).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is pgvector?\n",
    "\n",
    "[pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) is a PostgreSQL extension that provides vector similarity search capabilities. It allows you to store and query vector embeddings in your PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "[pgvector-python](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python) is a Python library for pgvector. It allows you to use pgvector with SQLAlchemy, making it easy to integrate pgvector into your existing Python applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is SQLAlchemy?\n",
    "\n",
    "[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is a Python library for interacting with databases. It provides a simple interface for executing SQL queries and managing database connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to get an LLM to answer questions about a document. We'll use the [A Deep Dive into DuckDB for Data Scientists](https://codecut.ai/deep-dive-into-duckdb-data-scientists/) article as our document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the [A Deep Dive into DuckDB for Data Scientists](https://codecut.ai/deep-dive-into-duckdb-data-scientists/) article as our document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Download the document and convert it to markdown.\n",
    "    - Split the document into chunks, each containing a single section of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Embed the chunks using the Ollama 'nomic-embed-text' model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vector Storage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Create PostgreSQL table with vector column using pgvector.\n",
    "    - Store document chunks and their embeddings in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Query Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Convert user query to embedding using Ollama.\n",
    "    - Use vector similarity search to find the most relevant chunks to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Response Generation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Retrieve the most relevant chunks from the database.\n",
    "    - Use Ollama's Llama 3.2 model to generate a response to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Workflow\n",

    "Response: DuckDB is a fast, in-process SQL OLAP database optimized for analytics. It offers several key features that make it an attractive option for data scientists, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Zero Configuration: No need to set up or maintain a separate database server.\n",
    "2. Memory Efficiency: Process large datasets without loading everything into memory.\n",
    "3. Familiar Interface: Use SQL syntax you already know, directly in Python.\n",
    "4. Performance: Faster than pandas for many operations, especially joins and aggregations.\n",
    "5. File Format Support: Direct querying of CSV, Parquet, and other file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "DuckDB provides a streamlined approach to data querying without the overhead of setting up database servers. It significantly outperforms pandas in terms of both performance and memory efficiency, especially when handling complex operations like joins and aggregations on large datasets.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The response is accurate and relevant to the query!\n",

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple example of how to use pgvector to create a RAG system. There are many ways to improve this example. Here are some ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replace the article with your own content and ask custom questions.\n",
    "- Try different embedding models or distance functions (e.g., cosine_distance).\n",
    "- Experiment with chunk sizes and splitting strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for this example! I hope you found it helpful."
